description: "Community-driven FAQ for Riftbound judges and players"
---

This is a community-driven, open source wiki to help you learn Riftbound's rules through practical examples and explanations.
Created with input from experienced judges, each page breaks down common questions about rules interactions and gameplay scenarios.

## Purpose [#purpose]

If you've wondered about how specific card interactions work or when certain game mechanics apply, you're in the right place.
Each page walks through common questions with examples and references to the official Core Rules Document, making it easier to understand the "why" behind the rulings.
These pages are also handy for sharing in community discussions when the same questions come up.

## About Rule References [#rule-references]

Each page shows which version of the Core Rules Document (CRD) it references - you'll see either a green "up-to-date" or yellow "outdated" notice at the top.
When a page references an older CRD version, all rule number links point to that specific version until the page gets updated.
Rule numbers sometimes change between CRD versions, but the rules themselves rarely change significantly.

Remember: the official CRD is always the ultimate authority for Riftbound rules.
This FAQ exists to help you learn through examples and explanations, not to replace the official rules.

## Contributing [#contributing]

This wiki is an open source project maintained by the Riftbound community.
If you'd like to contribute new content, fix errors, or improve existing pages, contributions are welcome!
Every page has an "Edit this page" button that takes you directly to GitHub where you can suggest changes.

## Using This Wiki [#using]

Browse the pages to learn about specific rules questions, card interactions, and gameplay scenarios.
Each page includes practical examples showing how the rules work in real game situations, with rule numbers linking to the official CRD and card names linking to the gallery.
The examples help you understand not just what the ruling is, but why it works that way.

description: "Community-driven FAQ for Riftbound judges and players"
---

This is a community-driven, open source FAQ to help you learn Riftbound's rules through practical examples and explanations.
Created with input from experienced judges, each page breaks down common questions about rules interactions and gameplay scenarios.

## Using This FAQ [#using]

If you've wondered about how specific card interactions work or when certain game mechanics apply, you're in the right place.
Each page walks through common questions with practical examples and references to the official Core Rules Document, helping you understand not just what the ruling is, but why it works that way.
Rule numbers link to the official CRD and card names link to the gallery.
These pages are also handy for sharing in community discussions when the same questions come up.

## About Rule References [#rule-references]

Each page shows which version of the Core Rules Document it references - you'll see either a green "up-to-date" or yellow "outdated" notice at the top.
When a page references an older CRD version, all rule number links point to that specific version until the page gets updated.
Rule numbers sometimes change between CRD versions, but the rules themselves rarely change significantly.

Remember: the official CRD is always the ultimate authority for Riftbound rules.
This FAQ exists to help you learn through examples and explanations, not to replace the official rules.

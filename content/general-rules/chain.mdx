## Can I play a Reaction after one, but not all, items on the Chain have resolved?

Yes, once you have gained Priority.
The Chain does not have to resolve in its entirety prior to (re)gaining Priority, unlike in some other TCGs.

<Rule number="333.1.c.3" /> and <Rule number="336.4" /> describe that any time the most recent item on the Chain resolves and there are no Pending Items, the controller of the newest item on the Chain gains Priority.

**Example**:
Player A puts Singularity on the Chain targeting a unit of Player B.
Following that Player B reacts by putting their Wind Wall on the Chain, attempting to counter the Singularity.
In response, Player A plays Stupefy, in the hopes of drawing into a counterspell of their own.
Once Stupefy resolves and Player A draws a card Priority is back to Player B as the most recent item is their Wind Wall.
After they pass Priority, Player A can react once again and play their own counterspell, assuming they drew it off of the Stupefy.

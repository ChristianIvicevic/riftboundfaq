## When do I pay costs within instructions of Triggered Abilities using "may"?

On resolution.

In rules text phrased as "[do X] to [do Y]," the [do X] part is considered a cost within instructions.
These costs within instructions are not targets for the purposes of finalising an ability and are not paid during finalisation (<Rule number="352.10" />, <Rule number="352.10.c" />, <Rule number="352.10.c.1" />).
Therefore, opponents who react to this Triggered Ability will not know whether the controller will choose to pay the cost or not.

**Example**:
[Vayne, Hunter](https://riftbound.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/card-gallery/#card-gallery--ogn-035-298)'s "When I conquer, you may pay [1] to return me to my owner's hand." will trigger when you conquer, opening a moment of opportunity to react.
On resolution of this ability, you can decline to pay the [1] cost, and the ability will resolve to no effect.

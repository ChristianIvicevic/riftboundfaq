## Can I play a Reaction after one, but not all, items on the Chain have resolved? [#reaction-after-partial-chain]

Yes, once you have gained Priority.
The Chain does not have to resolve in its entirety prior to (re)gaining Priority, unlike in some other TCGs.

Any time the most recent item on the Chain resolves and there are no Pending Items, the controller of the newest item on the Chain gains Priority (<Rule number="333.1.c.3" />, <Rule number="336.4" />).

<Callout type="idea" title="Example">
	You put [Singularity](https://riftbound.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/card-gallery/#card-gallery--ogn-105-298) on the Chain targeting an opponent's unit.
	Your opponent reacts by putting their [Wind Wall](https://riftbound.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/card-gallery/#card-gallery--ogn-064-298) on the Chain, attempting to counter the Singularity.
	In response, you play [Stupefy](https://riftbound.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/card-gallery/#card-gallery--ogn-095-298), in the hopes of drawing into a counterspell of your own.
	Once Stupefy resolves and you draw a card, Priority is back to your opponent as the most recent item is their Wind Wall.
	After they pass Priority, you can react once again and play your own counterspell, assuming you drew it off of the Stupefy.

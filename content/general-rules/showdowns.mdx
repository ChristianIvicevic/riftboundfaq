## When does a Showdown close? [#showdown-close]

Once initiated, a Showdown *never* closes abruptly.
A Showdown will only end once all players have consecutively passed Focus on an empty Chain (<Rule number="345" />).

<Callout type="idea" title="Example">
	You control a battlefield with a [Stalwart Poro](https://riftbound.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/card-gallery/#card-gallery--ogn-052-298) on it.
	Your opponent moves their [Ravenbloom Student](https://riftbound.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/card-gallery/#card-gallery--ogn-103-298) into that battlefield starting a Showdown.
	Once your opponent gains Focus, they play [Hextech Ray](https://riftbound.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/card-gallery/#card-gallery--ogn-009-298) targeting the Stalwart Poro which successfully resolves and kills it.
	The Showdown *does not* end right away and you gain Focus as usual.
	You still have the opportunity to play spells in an attempt to prevent your opponent from conquering.

## What happens when I move a unit into a non-combat Showdown? [#non-combat-showdown]

The ongoing non-combat Showdown continues as usual with Focus and Priority being passed back and forth until all players have consecutively passed Focus on an empty Chain (<Rule number="345" />).
Since there is no Combat yet, combat-related keywords (such as <Assault /> or <Shield />) have no effect, no Attacker or Defender designations are assigned, and Attack or Defend triggers do not happen.

When the non-combat Showdown closes with units of two players still remaining, a Combat will be Staged (<Rule number="345.2.b" />) as part of a Cleanup (<Rule number="322.10" />).
Once staged, a Combat (which includes its own Showdown) will open as usual, with the player who contested the battlefield first becoming the Attacker (<Rule number="345.2.b.1" />), not necessarily the one who moved in last.

## When do Attack/Defend triggers happen? [#attack-defend-triggers]

Attack and Defend triggered abilities (such as "When I attack" or "When I defend") trigger when a unit receives its Attacker or Defender designation, not necessarily at the start of combat.
These designations are assigned during Cleanups (<Rule number="322.5" />), which means units don't need to be present at the beginning of combat to get their triggers.

### Units can join combat late and still trigger

If a unit is moved into a battlefield where combat is already in progress, it will receive the appropriate Attacker or Defender designation during the next Cleanup (<Rule number="322.5.a" />).
When it receives this designation, any "When I attack" or "When I defend" abilities will trigger at that time.

<Callout type="idea" title="Example">
	Combat has started at a battlefield where you are the Attacker.
	During the Showdown, you play [Ride the Wind](https://riftbound.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/card-gallery/#card-gallery--ogn-173-298) to move your [Draven, Vanquisher](https://riftbound.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/card-gallery/#card-gallery--sfd-020-221) (which reads "When I attack or defend, you may pay <Power type="fury" />. If you do, give me +2 Might this turn.") from your Base to that battlefield.
	When the spell resolves and the subsequent Cleanup occurs, Draven gains the Attacker designation and his "When I attack" ability triggers.
	You may pay <Power type="fury" /> to give him +2 Might, even though he wasn't there when combat started.
</Callout>

### Attack/Defend abilities only trigger once per combat

Attack and Defend triggered abilities can only trigger once per combat, even if a unit gains and loses its designation multiple times (<Rule number="376.4.d.2.a" />, <Rule number="376.4.e.2.a" />).

Once a unit has been assigned an Attacker or Defender designation during a combat, moving it away from the battlefield will cause it to lose that designation (<Rule number="322.5.c" />).
If that unit is moved back to the same battlefield during the same combat, it will gain the same designation as its controller (<Rule number="322.5.a" />), which will be the same designation it previously had.
However, its "When I attack" or "When I defend" ability will not trigger again, as these abilities can only be fulfilled once per combat.

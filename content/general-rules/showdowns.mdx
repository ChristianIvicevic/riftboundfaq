## When does a Showdown close?

Once initiated, a Showdown *never* closes abruptly.
As per <Rule number="345" /> a Showdown will only end once all players have consecutively passed Focus on an empty Chain.

**Example**:
You control a battlefield with a Stalwart Poro on it.
Your opponent moves their Ravenbloom Student into that battlefield starting a Showdown.
Once your opponent gains Focus, they play Hextech Ray targeting the Stalwart Poro which successfully resolves and kills it.
The Showdown *does not* end right away and you gain Focus as usual.
You still have the opportunity to play spells in an attempt to prevent your opponent from conquering.

## What happens when I move a unit into a non-combat Showdown?

Based on <Rule number="345" /> the ongoing non-combat Showdown continues as usual with Focus and Priority being passed back and forth.
Since there is no Combat yet, combat-related keywords (such as Assault or Shield) have no effect, no Attacker or Defender designations are assigned, and Attack or Defend triggers do not happen.

When the non-combat Showdown closes with units of two players still remaining, a Combat will be Staged (<Rule number="345.2.b" />) as part of a Cleanup (<Rule number="322.10" />).
Once staged, a Combat (which includes its own Showdown) will open as usual, with the player who contested the battlefield first becoming the Attacker (<Rule number="345.2.b.1" />), not necessarily the one who moved in last.

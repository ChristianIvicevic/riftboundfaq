## When does a Showdown close?

Once initiated, a Showdown *never* closes abruptly.
As per <Rule number="345" /> a Showdown will only end once all players have consecutively passed Focus on an empty Chain.

**Example**:
You control a battlefield with a Stalwart Poro on it.
Your opponent moves their Ravenbloom Student into that battlefield starting a Showdown.
Once your opponent gains Focus, they play Hextech Ray targeting the Stalwart Poro which successfully resolves and kills it.
The Showdown *does not* end right away and you gain Focus as usual.
You still have the opportunity to play spells in an attempt to prevent your opponent from conquering.

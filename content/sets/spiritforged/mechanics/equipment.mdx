## What happens to attached equipment when a unit dies? [#equipment-when-unit-dies]

The equipment detaches and remains at the unit's last location, recalling if at a battlefield.

When a unit with attached equipment dies, the equipment detaches and remains at the location the unit occupied before dying (<Rule number="719.5" />, <Rule number="422.4.b" />).

If that location is a battlefield, the detached equipment will be recalled to its controller's base during the next Cleanup (<Rule number="422.4.a" />).
If that location is the controller's base, the equipment simply remains there.

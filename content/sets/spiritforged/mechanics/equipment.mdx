## What happens to attached equipment when a unit dies? [#when-unit-dies]

The equipment detaches and remains at the unit's last location, recalling if at a battlefield.

When a unit with attached equipment dies, the equipment detaches and remains at the location the unit occupied before dying (<Rule number="719.5" />, <Rule number="422.4.b" />).

If that location is a battlefield, the detached equipment will be recalled to its controller's base during the next Cleanup (<Rule number="422.4.a" />).
If that location is the controller's base, the equipment simply remains there.

## What happens to attached equipment when you take control of an enemy unit? [#take-control-with-equipment]

Equipment stays attached but its controller does not change - only the top-most unit's controller changes.

When you take control of a unit, any equipment attached to it remains controlled by whoever originally controlled it.
Changes in control of the top-most card do not affect control of attached cards, and vice versa (<Rule number="718.8.a" />).

When the equipment detaches, it remains at the unit's last location (<Rule number="719.5" />, <Rule number="422.4.b" />).
If that location is a battlefield, it is recalled to its controller's base during the next Cleanup (<Rule number="422.4.a" />).
If that location is the your base, it cannot remain there since other players cannot have game objects they control in another player's base (<Rule number="106.2.d" />), so it goes to its controller's base.

Since the equipment is still controlled by its original owner, they can also use a unit with <Weaponmaster /> to pull it back, even while it remains attached - attached cards can still be chosen by game effects (<Rule number="718.5.b" />, <Rule number="747.1.c" />).

## Which equipment effects choose units? [#choose-units]

<Equip /> and <QuickDraw /> choose units; <Weaponmaster /> does not.

Some abilities trigger or care about when you choose friendly units. Here's how equipment-related effects interact with such abilities:

- When you activate a gear's <Equip /> ability, you choose a unit you control to attach the equipment to (<Rule number="744.1.b.1" />).
This choice is a target, so activating <Equip /> counts as choosing a unit.
- When you play a gear with <QuickDraw />, its triggered ability instructs you to "attach it to a Unit you control" (<Rule number="745.1.d" />).
While attaching cards doesn't inherently choose or specify a target (<Rule number="421.3" />), <QuickDraw />'s ability does require you to choose which unit to attach to.
This counts as choosing a unit.
- When you play a unit with <Weaponmaster />, you choose an equipment you control, not the unit (<Rule number="747.1.c" />).
The rules explicitly state that "The <Equip /> ability is not activated this way, and the unit with the <Weaponmaster /> ability is not chosen" (<Rule number="747.1.c.6" />).
Therefore, <Weaponmaster /> does **not** count as choosing a unit.

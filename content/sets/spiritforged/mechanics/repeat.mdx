## When do I decide whether to pay for Repeat? [#repeat-decision-timing]

You must decide whether to pay a spell's Repeat cost when you play the spell, not later.

When you play a spell with Repeat, you follow the normal process for playing a card (<Rule number="350" />):
1. First, you put the spell onto the Chain (<Rule number="351" />)
2. Then, you make necessary choices (<Rule number="352" />), including whether or not you will Repeat it (<Rule number="352.1" />, <Rule number="746.1.d" />)
3. Next, you determine its total cost (<Rule number="353" />).
If you chose to Repeat the spell, you apply the Repeat cost as an Optional Additional Cost (<Rule number="353.2" />, <Rule number="353.2.b" />, <Rule number="353.2.b.1" />, <Rule number="746.1.d" />)
4. Finally, you complete the remaining steps of playing the card to finalize the spell

This means you cannot put a spell on the Chain, pass Priority to see what happens, and then decide whether to Repeat it later.
The decision must be made upfront during finalization.

<Callout type="idea" title="Example">
	You put [Blood Rush](https://riftbound.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/card-gallery/#card-gallery--sfd-003-221), a spell with <Repeat /> <Energy value={1} />, that says "Give a unit <Assault value={2} /> this turn.", onto the Chain.
	Before anyone can respond, you must decide: are you paying the <Energy value={1} /> to Repeat it and give <Assault value={2} /> twice to units, or not?
	Once you've made this choice and paid costs, the spell is finalized.
	Your opponent can now respond with Priority, but your Repeat decision is locked in.

## What happens if a repeated spell is countered? [#countering-repeated-spells]

The entire spell is countered, including all repeated instructions.

Repeat does *not* create a second instance of the spell on the Chain.
Instead, it modifies how the spell resolves by executing its instructions an additional time (<Rule number="746.1.d.1" />).

When a spell is countered, it does nothing and is placed in the Trash (<Rule number="412.1.a" />).
Since the spell never resolves, none of its instructions are executed, whether they came from Repeat or not.

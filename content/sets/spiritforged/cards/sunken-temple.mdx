## Does Sunken Temple trigger if I conquer with a unit that is only Mighty due to Assault? [#mighty-from-assault]

No.
Sunken Temple will not trigger if a unit is only Mighty because of the bonus Might it gained from <Assault />.

By the time "when you conquer" triggers are evaluated, units have already lost their Attacker designation during the combat special cleanup (<Rule number="444.1.a.3" />), which means they no longer have <Assault /> active.
This happens before control is established and the conquer occurs (<Rule number="444.2" />).

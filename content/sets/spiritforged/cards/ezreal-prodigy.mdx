## What are "optional additional costs"? [#what-are-optional-additional-costs]

Optional additional costs are costs that (<Rule number="353.2.b.1" />):

1. Use the exact phrase "as an additional cost"
2. Include the word "may"

Ezreal, Prodigy's passive ability ("Optional additional costs you pay cost <Energy value={1} /> or <Power type="universal" /> less.") only reduces costs that meet both criteria.
<Accelerate /> and <Repeat /> are keyworded instances of optional additional costs (<Rule number="731.1.a" />, <Rule number="746.1.d" />), so they are also reduced by Ezreal's ability.

Optional additional costs are determined when you calculate a card's total cost during the playing process, and Ezreal's discount is applied when you apply discounts (<Rule number="353.4" />).

<Callout type="idea" title="Example">
	[Blast Corps Cadet](https://riftbound.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/card-gallery/#card-gallery--sfd-013-221)'s ability reads "You may pay <Energy value={1} /><Power type="fury" /> as an additional cost to play me."
	This is an optional additional cost because it uses both "as an additional cost" AND "may."
	Ezreal's ability would reduce this cost to <Energy value={1} /> or <Power type="fury" />.
</Callout>

<Callout type="idea" title="Example">
	You play [Sivir, Mercenary](https://riftbound.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/card-gallery/#card-gallery--sfd-143a-221) with <Accelerate /><Energy value={1} /><Power type="chaos" /> while you control Ezreal, Prodigy.
	With Ezreal's ability, you can choose to reduce this to either <Energy value={1} /> or <Power type="chaos" />.
</Callout>

## What doesn't count as an optional additional cost? [#not-optional-additional-costs]

Several similar-looking costs are NOT optional additional costs and are not reduced by Ezreal's ability.

### Mandatory additional costs [#mandatory-additional-costs]

<Callout type="idea" title="Example">
	[Cruel Patron](https://riftbound.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/card-gallery/#card-gallery--ogn-208-298) reads "As an additional cost to play me, kill a friendly unit."
	This is NOT an optional additional cost - it uses "as an additional cost" but not "may," making it a mandatory additional cost (<Rule number="353.2.a.1" />).
</Callout>

### Costs within instructions [#costs-within-instructions]

<Callout type="idea" title="Example">
	[Hard Bargain](https://riftbound.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/card-gallery/#card-gallery--sfd-136-221) reads "Counter a spell unless its controller pays <Energy value={2} />."
	This is NOT an optional additional cost.
	The <Energy value={2} /> is a cost within the spell's instruction, not an additional cost to play Hard Bargain.
</Callout>

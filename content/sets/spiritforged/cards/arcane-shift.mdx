## Can I use Arcane Shift to banish my only unit at a battlefield and replay it there? [#replay-at-same-battlefield]

Yes, but only if you are the defender during combat.

The key is understanding when you choose where to play the banished unit and when battlefield control is lost.

### How Arcane Shift Resolves [#resolution-process]

When Arcane Shift resolves, the following happens:

1. "Banish a friendly unit" - the unit leaves the board and goes to banishment
2. "then its owner plays it, ignoring its cost" - the unit goes on the chain as a Pending Item (<Rule number="351.3" />), but **you don't choose where to play it yet**
3. "Deal 3 to an enemy unit" and "Banish this" both resolve
4. Arcane Shift finishes resolving and a Cleanup occurs
5. **Cleanup Step 4** (<Rule number="322.6" />): Battlefields with no units **and no Contested status** become Uncontrolled
6. **Cleanup Step 8** (<Rule number="322.12" />): The banished unit finalizes and you choose where to play it

**The critical timing**: the battlefield's control status is determined in step 4, before you choose where to play the unit in step 8.

### During Combat (Defender Only) [#during-combat]

During combat, the battlefield has **Contested status**, so cleanup step 4 does NOT make it Uncontrolled.

When the unit finalizes in step 8, the battlefield is still controlled by you (the defender) and is a valid location.
Control is only established or lost later in the Combat Resolution Step (<Rule number="444.2" />).

**Important**: Attackers cannot replay their units to the battlefield because attackers never control the battlefield they're attacking in the first place (<Rule number="184.4.b" />).

### Outside of Combat [#outside-combat]

Outside of combat, there is **no Contested status**, so cleanup step 4 makes the battlefield Uncontrolled immediately (<Rule number="184.4.c" />).

When the unit finalizes in step 8, the battlefield is no longer controlled by you and is not a valid location.
You must replay the unit to your base or a different battlefield you control.

## How does Switcheroo actually work? [#how-it-works]

Switcheroo doesn't actually swap Might values - it determines the difference in effective Might when it resolves and applies +X/-X Might modifiers respectively.
Nothing more, nothing less.

Despite the card reading "Swap the Might of two units at the same battlefield this turn," the game doesn't swap the values directly.
Instead, Switcheroo uses the Swap action (<Rule number="420" />), which determines the difference between the two units' current Might values, then applies a -X modifier to the higher Might unit and a +X modifier to the lower Might unit.

Current Might means the unit's total Might including all active modifiers - equipment bonuses, battlefield passives, conditional abilities, and any other effects currently affecting it.
The modifiers that Switcheroo applies persist until end of turn.

## Can I apply equipment bonuses or passive effects after Switcheroo resolves? [#no-double-dipping]

No.
Equipment bonuses, battlefield passives, and conditional abilities are already factored into the current Might when Switcheroo resolves.

This is the most common misconception about Switcheroo.
Players often think they can "double-dip" by applying these modifiers after the swap, but Switcheroo calculates based on total current Might at resolution time.

Consider this example: You have a unit with 2 base Might and attached equipment granting +3 Might, giving it 5 current Might total.
Your opponent has a 1 Might unit at the same battlefield.
When Switcheroo resolves, it calculates the difference of 4, then applies -4 to your unit and +4 to your opponent's unit.
Your unit ends up with 1 Might while your opponent's unit has 5 Might.

The equipment bonus is already included in this calculation - Switcheroo saw your unit as having 5 Might when it resolved.
You cannot reapply the +3 equipment bonus after the fact to get a different result.

## What happens when equipment detaches or passives stop applying after Switcheroo? [#modifiers-changing]

The Switcheroo modifier persists, but the equipment/passive bonus is removed, which can result in very low or negative Might.

Switcheroo's +X/-X modifiers last until end of turn, but equipment bonuses and passive effects have their own conditions for when they apply.
When these conditions change, only their specific bonus is added or removed - the Switcheroo modifier remains.

### Equipment Detaching [#equipment-detaching]

Continuing the previous example where your unit has 1 Might after Switcheroo - if the equipment detaches, things get interesting.
Your unit loses the +3 equipment bonus but keeps the -4 modifier from Switcheroo, leaving it with -2 Might (2 base - 4 from Switcheroo).

This happens because Switcheroo calculated based on the equipment being attached at resolution time.
The spell saw your unit as having 5 total Might and applied a -4 modifier accordingly.
When the equipment detaches later, only its +3 bonus is removed - the -4 from Switcheroo remains active until end of turn.

### Passives [#passives]

Passive abilities work the same way - they apply based on conditions and can turn on or off during the turn.

[Trifarian War Camp](https://riftbound.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/card-gallery/#card-gallery--ogn-294-298) creates a straightforward example.
The battlefield grants units +1 Might while they're present.
If your 1 Might unit at War Camp (currently 2 Might with the battlefield bonus) swaps with your opponent's 6 Might unit at the same battlefield, Switcheroo applies +4 to your unit and -4 to your opponent's.
Your unit now has 6 Might total (1 base + 4 from Switcheroo + 1 from War Camp).
If your unit later moves away from War Camp, it loses the +1 bonus and drops to 5 Might, but the +4 from Switcheroo stays until end of turn.

[Wuju Bladesman](https://riftbound.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/card-gallery/#card-gallery--ogs-019-024) demonstrates how conditional passives interact with Switcheroo.
Wuju Bladesman's ability grants a friendly unit +2 Might while it defends alone.
Suppose your 3 Might unit is defending alone against your opponent's 1 Might attacker, making your defender's current Might 5 with Wuju's bonus.
Your opponent plays Switcheroo targeting both units.
Switcheroo calculates the difference of 4 and applies -4 to your defender and +4 to the attacker.
Your defender now has 1 Might (3 base - 4 from Switcheroo + 2 from Wuju) while it's still defending alone.
After combat ends or another friendly unit joins the defense, Wuju's passive deactivates and your unit drops to -1 Might.

The key insight is that each modifier is independent.
When equipment detaches or passives deactivate, only their specific bonus is removed - the Switcheroo modifier stays until end of turn.

## Can Switcheroo result in negative Might? [#negative-might]

Yes, but the unit treats its Might as 0 for game purposes while calculations still use the actual negative value.

As shown in the previous examples, units can end up with negative Might when modifiers that contributed to their current Might at resolution time are later removed.
The rules state that units with Might less than 0 treat it as 0 for all purposes (<Rule number="142.2.b" />).
This means the unit contributes 0 Might in combat and effects that reference the unit's Might see 0, but the underlying value is still negative for calculation purposes.

Importantly, units with 0 or negative Might don't automatically die.
Units are only killed during cleanup if they have non-zero damage marked on them equalling or exceeding their Might (<Rule number="322.4" />).
A unit at -2 Might with no damage marked on it will survive - it just can't contribute to combat or defend itself effectively.

If a unit later gains additional Might modifiers, they add to the actual negative value.

<Callout type="idea" title="Example">
	Suppose a unit with -2 Might is targeted with [Punch First](https://riftbound.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/card-gallery/#card-gallery--sfd-097-221), which reads "Give a unit +5 Might this turn."
	The unit ends up with 3 Might (not 5) - the +5 modifier adds to the actual -2 value, resulting in 3 total Might.

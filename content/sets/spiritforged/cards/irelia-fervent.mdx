## If I target Irelia with a spell and that spell gets countered, does she still get +1 Might? [#choosing-happens-before-counter]

Yes.

Irelia is chosen as a target during step 2 of playing the spell - the "Make necessary choices" step (<Rule number="352" />, <Rule number="352.4" />, <Rule number="352.6" />).
This happens before the spell is finalized on the chain and before opponents have any opportunity to react.
Her triggered ability fires the moment she is chosen, because a trigger's condition is evaluated as soon as the inciting event has been processed (<Rule number="376.2.c" />).
The trigger is not contingent on the spell that caused it successfully resolving.
Countering the spell (<Rule number="412.1.a" />) only prevents the spell from resolving - it has no bearing on Irelia's already-triggered ability.

<Callout type="idea" title="Example">
	You play a spell targeting Irelia.
	Irelia's ability has already triggered at the moment you chose her - before the spell is even finalized.
	Your opponent reacts and counters the spell.
	The spell does nothing and goes to the trash, but Irelia's +1 Might trigger is already on the chain and resolves normally.

## Does Blade Dancer's ability trigger Irelia's +1 Might? [#blade-dancer]

Not from choosing - but she can still trigger from being readied if she was exhausted.

[Blade Dancer](https://riftbound.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/card-gallery/#card-gallery--sfd-195-221) does not choose a unit - it does not target (<Rule number="352.10.d" />, <Rule number="352.10.d.1" />).
"It" in "ready it" deterministically refers back to the unit already identified as Blade Dancer's trigger condition, with no separate choice made by the player.
Irelia's ability can only trigger from Blade Dancer if she was exhausted and is readied by it - and only through the readying half of her ability, not the choosing half (<Rule number="402.1" />).

## Does Irelia get +1 Might when she readies during the Awaken Step? [#readying-during-awaken-step]

Yes, but only if she was exhausted and actually transitions to the ready state.

During the Awaken Phase at the start of each turn, the turn player readies all game objects they control that are able to be readied (<Rule number="315.1.a" />).
Readying is the action of marking a game object as available for action (<Rule number="402.1" />).
If Irelia was exhausted, she transitions to ready and her trigger fires.

If she is already ready at the start of your turn, she cannot be readied again (<Rule number="402.1.b" />, <Rule number="402.1.c" />) - no readying event occurs and the trigger does not fire.

## Does a Repeat spell targeting Irelia for both instructions give her +1 Might twice? [#repeat-targeting-twice]

Yes.

<Repeat /> is functionally "execute the spell's instructions one additional time" (<Rule number="746.1.d" />).
When the Repeat cost is paid, choices for both executions are made during the same "Make necessary choices" step of playing the card (<Rule number="746.2" />, <Rule number="746.2.a" />).
Choosing Irelia for the first instruction and choosing her for the second are two separate choosing events - her triggered ability fires once for each.

<Callout type="idea" title="Example">
	You play [Feral Strength](https://riftbound.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/card-gallery/#card-gallery--sfd-034-221) and pay its <Repeat /> cost, choosing Irelia for both instructions.
	As you make your choices for the spell, Irelia's ability triggers twice - once per choosing event - and both triggers go on the chain.
	When her triggers resolve, she receives +1 and +1 from her own ability.
	When the spell resolves, Irelia receives +2 and +2 from the spell's two instructions.
	That's +6 Might total this turn.

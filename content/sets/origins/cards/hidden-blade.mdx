## Does the target's controller draw if the unit isn't killed?

Yes, as long as the target is still legal when Hidden Blade resolves.

The card draw is not contingent on successfully killing the unit - it only requires that the targeted unit remains a legal target (a unit at a battlefield) when Hidden Blade resolves.

**Example**:
You play Hidden Blade targeting an opponent's unit.
They respond with Zhonya's Hourglass, which replaces the unit's death.
The unit is not killed, but because it was still a legal target when Hidden Blade resolved, the opponent still draws 2.

<Rule number="356.3.e.5" /> establishes that illegal targets are unaffected by spells, but legal targets are processed normally regardless of outcome.

## Does the controller draw if the target becomes illegal?

No.
If the target is no longer a legal target when Hidden Blade resolves, no part of the spell affects that target - including the card draw.

**Example**:
You play Hidden Blade targeting an opponent's unit at a battlefield.
They respond by moving it to their base using Flash.
Hidden Blade resolves, but the unit is no longer at a battlefield, making it an illegal target.
The unit is not killed and the opponent does not draw.

This is because Hidden Blade checks information about the target ("its controller") to determine who draws.
When a target becomes illegal, any information checks about that target return "null" and are ignored, as described in <Rule number="356.3.e.12" />.

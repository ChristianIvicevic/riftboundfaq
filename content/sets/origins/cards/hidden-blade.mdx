## Does the target's controller draw if the unit isn't killed? [#draw-if-not-killed]

Yes, as long as the target is still legal when Hidden Blade resolves.

The card draw is not contingent on successfully killing the unit - it only requires that the targeted unit remains a legal target (a unit at a battlefield) when Hidden Blade resolves.

<Callout type="idea" title="Example">
	You play Hidden Blade targeting an opponent's unit.
	They respond with [Zhonya's Hourglass](https://riftbound.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/card-gallery/#card-gallery--ogn-077-298), which replaces the unit's death.
	The unit is not killed, but because it was still a legal target when Hidden Blade resolved, the opponent still draws 2.
</Callout>

Illegal targets are unaffected by spells, but legal targets are processed normally regardless of outcome (<Rule number="356.3.e.5" />).

## Does the controller draw if the target becomes illegal? [#draw-if-illegal]

No.
If the target is no longer a legal target when Hidden Blade resolves, no part of the spell affects that target - including the card draw.

<Callout type="idea" title="Example">
	You play Hidden Blade targeting an opponent's unit at a battlefield.
	They respond by moving it to their base using [Flash](https://riftbound.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/card-gallery/#card-gallery--ogs-011-024).
	Hidden Blade resolves, but the unit is no longer at a battlefield, making it an illegal target.
	The unit is not killed and the opponent does not draw.
</Callout>

This is because Hidden Blade checks information about the target ("its controller") to determine who draws.
When a target becomes illegal, any information checks about that target return "null" and are ignored (<Rule number="356.3.e.12" />).

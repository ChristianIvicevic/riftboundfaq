## Do players draw if the target becomes illegal?

**No.** Whether the targeted player draws depends on whether the target is still legal when Hidden Blade resolves.

### When the player DOES draw
- The targeted unit is still at a battlefield when Hidden Blade resolves
- The unit was moved to a different battlefield (still at "a battlefield")

### When the player does NOT draw
- The unit was moved to a base
- The unit was killed by another effect
- The unit was returned to hand
- The unit changed zones in any way that makes it no longer "a unit at a battlefield"

## Why?

According to rule **356.3.e.12** of the Riftbound Core Rules:

> If the spell checks information about a target that is no longer legal or a card or permanent whose location, zone, or status has changed such that that information is no longer available, that check returns "null" and all calculations based on it are ignored.

When Hidden Blade says "Its controller draws 2," the word "its" refers to the targeted unit. If the unit is no longer a legal target at resolution (because it's no longer at a battlefield), you cannot determine what "its controller" refers to—the reference returns null. Therefore, the draw instruction is ignored.

### Related rule: **356.3.e.5**

> If any of the spell's targets are no longer legal, those targets are unaffected by the spell as it resolves.

The unit won't be killed if it's no longer a legal target, AND the controller won't draw because "its controller" cannot be determined.
